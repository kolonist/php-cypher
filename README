This PHP Class simplifies using of Mcrypt PHP extention to encrypt or
decrypt strings and files.

This class has very simple usage but it provides a bit more secure way to
encrypt files than standart Mcrypt functions does:
    - passwords always derivated using HMAC
    - if message length isn't multiple of block size then it appended with
      pseudorandom octets
